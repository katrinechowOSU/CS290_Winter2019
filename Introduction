Hello!

Happy new year :)

My name is Katrine, from the San Francisco Bay Area in California. I am in my second year of the Post-Bac CS program.
I'm currently working full time as an Administrative Assistant. Hopefully I will be able to transition to a technical role soon.

Hope you had a good holiday break.

Kind Regards,
Katrine
